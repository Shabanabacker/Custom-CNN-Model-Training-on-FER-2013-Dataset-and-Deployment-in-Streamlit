# Custom-CNN-Model-Training-on-FER-2013-Dataset-and-Deployment-in-Streamlit

This project implements facial emotion recognition using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on the **FER-2013** dataset. It also includes a **Streamlit** web application to predict emotions from user-uploaded images.

## Features

- **Model Training**: Custom CNN model trained on FER-2013 dataset.
- **Real-time Emotion Prediction**: Streamlit app for predicting emotions from images.

## Dataset

- **FER-2013**: Contains grayscale images of faces, each labeled with one of seven emotions (Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, Surprise).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/facial-emotion-recognition.git
   cd facial-emotion-recognition
